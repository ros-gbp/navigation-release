    Fixed race condition with costmaps in LayeredCostmap::resizeMap()
    LayeredCostmap::updateMap() and LayeredCostmap::resizeMap() write to the master grid costmap.
    And these two functions can be called by different threads at the same time.
    One example of these cases is a race condition between subscriber callback thread
    dealing with dynamically-size-changing static_layer and periodical updateMap() calls from Costmap2DROS thread.
    Under the situation the master grid costmap is not thread-safe.
    LayeredCostmap::updateMap() already used the master grid costmap's lock.

ros-kinetic-costmap-2d (1.14.0-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Reordered initializer list to match order of declarations.
    This avoids compiler warning with some compilers.
  * Made update map threadsafe
    This is necessary for some plugins (e.g. VoxelLayer) that implement a
    thread unsafe updateBounds() function.
  * Fix bug with resetting static layer
    If we don't have a new topic, consider our old data as if it were new.
  * fix resource locations to fix tests
  * Increase time-limit on failing test
  * Merge pull request #388 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/388> from yujinrobot/jade_inflation_ghost_fix
    No more ghosts in the inflation layer
  * Fixes the dynamic reconfigure segfault
    Doing a dynamic reconfigure of the inflation radius recreates
    the cached cost values without first locking a mutex, which causes
    a segfault. This breaks the reconfigure of inflation parameters into
    a separate function and adds a mutex lock.
  * Merge pull request #415 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/415> from alexhenning/jade-fix-multiple-static-layers
    Fixes an issue with having multiple static layers
  * Fixes an issue with having multiple static layers
    If you have a static layer in both the local and global costmaps that
    use the same map topic, there is a race condition that can cause the
    static layer to get stuck after printing Requesting map..... This race
    condition seems to be due to the call to shutdown in deactivate and how
    the NodeHandle handles multiple subscribers under the hood.
    This issue appears to happen about 1 in 1000 times in the setup I was
    testing. This fix has never failed in over 1000000 tests. Instead of
    calling activate and deactivate, the publisher is only recreated if the
    topic has changed. Otherwise, it reuses the old setup.
  * fix related to issue #408 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/408> - With Rolling Window on, costmap_2d not properly updating bounds and costs in the static layer
  * No more ghosts in the inflation layer
    Previous bounds would fit the sensor measurements, and the inflation layer would clear
    out to these, but leave 'ghosts' behind. These ghosts are from two sources - 1) the
    inflation radius and 2) whole obstacles left behind as the robot has moved from the last point.
    The modifications here remember the last bounds and set the new bounds so that a box at least
    large enough to incorporate the old bounds plus the inflation radius is generated.
