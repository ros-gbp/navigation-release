ros-melodic-amcl (1.14.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Allow AMCL to run from bag file to allow very fast testing.
  * Fixes interpretation of a delayed initialpose message (see #424 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/424>).
    The tf lookup as it was before this change was very likely to fail as
    ros::Time::now() was used to look up a tf without waiting on the tf's
    availability. Additionally, the computation of the "new pose" by
    multiplying the delta that the robot moved from the initialpose's
    timestamp to ros::Time::now() was wrong. That delta has to by multiplied
    from the right to the "old pose".
    This commit also changes the reference frame to look up this delta to be
    the odom frame as this one is supposed to be smooth and therefore the
    best reference to get relative robot motion in the robot (base link) frame.
  * New unit test for proper interpretation of a delayed initialpose message.
    Modifies the set_pose.py script to be able to send an initial pose with
    a user defined time stamp at a user defined time. Adds a rostest to
    exercise this new option.
    This reveals the issues mentioned in #424 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/424> (the new test fails).
